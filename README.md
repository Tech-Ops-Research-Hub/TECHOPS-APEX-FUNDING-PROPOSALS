## 💸 Funding Proposals

At **TechOps Apex**, we’re building powerful, community-driven ecosystems that empower developers, support innovation, and solve real-world challenges—especially in underserved and emerging regions. To sustain and scale our impact, we actively seek funding partnerships, sponsorships, and grants.

Our funding proposals are designed to support both the **technical development of open-source tools** and the **growth of inclusive, global tech communities**.

### 🧭 What We Fund & Build

We don’t just write code—we build ecosystems. Here are the core areas we focus on:

---

#### 🧑‍💻 1. **Open Source Development**
We create developer tools, SDKs, documentation platforms, and microservices that are free, extensible, and designed for real-world use. These tools power everything from solo developer workflows to scalable enterprise systems.

**Funding helps us:**
- Maintain and scale OSS tools and libraries
- Build technical documentation and onboarding flows
- Run CI/CD pipelines and deploy cloud infrastructure
- Sponsor contributors and maintainers
- Secure and audit codebases

We build inclusive tech communities across Africa and other emerging regions by organizing events, mentorships, and contributor programs.

**We host:**
- Local and global meetups, DevJams, hackathons & webinars
- Open source contributor cohorts and mentorship circles
- Technical writing and DevRel bootcamps
- Community leader training and support systems

---

#### 📚 3. **Developer Education & Upskilling**
We offer free, open-source curricula and hands-on workshops in core areas of software engineering, DevOps, AI, cloud, and technical writing—especially targeting students, junior devs, and career-switchers.

**Funding enables us to:**
- Build and publish high-quality courses and tutorials
- Translate learning content into local languages
- Record and distribute video-based technical courses
- Run mentorships, capstone projects, and certification support

---

#### 🌱 4. **Diversity, Equity & Inclusion**
We believe in building spaces where **everyone** has a seat at the table. We support underrepresented developers with scholarships, mentorships, and infrastructure to thrive.

**We use funding to:**
- Offer travel grants to tech events & conferences
